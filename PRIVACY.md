# Privacy Policy — LinkedIn Feed Blocker

**Last updated:** February 2025

## Summary

LinkedIn Feed Blocker does not collect, store, or transmit any personal data. All processing happens on your device.

## Data handling

- **No personal data collected.** The extension does not collect names, emails, or any identifying information.
- **No data sent to servers.** No analytics, tracking, or remote requests. No data leaves your browser to our or third-party servers.
- **Local processing only.** Filtering rules (keywords, blocked authors, settings) and session data (e.g. blocked post count) are stored only in Chrome’s local storage (chrome.storage) on your device.
- **No sharing.** We do not have access to your data and do not share any information with third parties.

## Storage

The extension uses Chrome’s built-in storage APIs:

- **chrome.storage.sync:** Your keywords, blocked authors, and extension settings (synced across your Chrome profile if you have sync enabled).
- **chrome.storage.local:** Local data such as the list of blocked posts in the current session and aggregated stats used only inside the extension.

This data stays on your device (and, for sync storage, in your Google account if sync is on). We do not read, export, or transmit it.

## Permissions

- **storage:** Used only to save and read your settings and local data as described above.
- **host_permissions (linkedin.com/feed):** Used only so the content script can run on the LinkedIn feed page to apply your filters. No content is sent elsewhere.

## Contact

For questions about this policy or the extension, use the contact details provided in the Chrome Web Store listing.
